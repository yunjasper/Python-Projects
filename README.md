## Hessian

A simple Python command-line program that computes the Hessian determinant given a point, the second-order partial derivatives, and the function. It returns the value of the Hessian determinant, the value of the second-order partial derivative with respect to x, and classifies the point given as either a saddle point, local maximum, or local minimum.

## Renamer

A command-line program that allows a user to input a path to a directory containing files to be renamed. The program renames the  files to a specified format and appends an index at the end of the given name. The file extensions are automatically retrieved, so the user cannot change file extensions.
